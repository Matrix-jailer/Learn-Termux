**What is Termux ?**

**Termux** is an Android terminal 
emulator and **Linux** environment app 
that works directly with 
no rooting or setup required. 
A minimal base system is installed 
automatically - additional packages 
are available using the APT **package manager**. 

**What can Termux Do ?**

**Termux** is a terminal emulator for **Android**. 
It can be considered to be more like a Linux 
distribution than just a terminal application 
due to a large number of available packages 
such as clang, FFmpeg, OpenSSH, Python, Vim.

**What is Termux API ?**

This is an app exposing Android **API**
to command line usage and scripts or programs. 
When developing or packaging, 
note that this app needs to be signed 
with the same key as the main **Termux** app 
for permissions to work 

(only the main **Termux** app are 
allowed to call the **API** methods in this app)

**Where are Termux files Stored ?**

The default directory is: */data/data/com. termux/files/home* .
Since Termux supports bash commands, 
user can run pwd to print current working directory.

Mkdir Stand for make directory. Type mkdir and give a space and type folder name and press enter.
I created a **newfolder** name directory with this command **mkdir newfolder** and then I used **ls** to see the directory

**Remove Directory üóëÔ∏è**

Delete a folder or a directory:
```
rmdir folderName
```
![IMG_20200721_234504](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66746496/88093985-3c051180-cbac-11ea-85c4-906608b238b5.jpg)
Please use this command with caution.This command will remove a folder and all the files and folders within it.This command is useful when you want to delete any project downloaded from Github.

In the last command we created a directory named **newfolder** and with this command we removed that **directory** successfully

**Copy**

Copy a file from one directory to another directory:
```
cp file-name file-path
```

You can copy files by typing cp the file name and after giving a space you can type the path where you wanna copy the file E.g: cp Word-Generix /storage/shared this will copy the Word-Generix to the storage/shared folder.

**Search Package üîé**

Search for the specific package in termux:
```
pkg search package-name
```
